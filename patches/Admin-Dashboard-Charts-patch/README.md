Magento currently uses Google Image Charts to render static charts in Magento 1.x Admin dashboards.  
As of March 14, 2019, Google will stop supporting [Google Image Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/).  
To resolve this issue, we are providing a patch to replace Google Image Charts with [Image-Charts](https://www.image-charts.com/) free service.  
More information available in our [DevBlog](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Google-Image-Charts-deprecation-and-update-for-M1/ba-p/125006).
